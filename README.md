# English-Malay Translator
This project implements an English-to-Malay Translator using the pretrained mesolitica/t5-base-standard-bahasa-cased T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model. The application is built with Streamlit, providing a user-friendly web interface for translating English sentences into Malay, with the ability to view translation history. The model was evaluated using a parallel dataset from the Asian Languages Treebank (ALT) with metrics such as BLEU, ChrF, TER, and METEOR.

## Features
